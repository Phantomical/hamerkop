I really wanna stop
But I just gotta taste for it
I feel like I could fly with the ball on the moon
So honey hold my hand you like making me wait for it
I feel like I could die walking up to the room, oh yeah

Late night watching television
But how we get in this position?
It's way too soon, I know this isn't love
But I need to tell you something
